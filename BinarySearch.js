// Solution
// Because the array is sorted, we can use binary search
// A binary search algorithm finds an item in a sorted array in O(lg(n))time.

// A brute force search would walk through the whole array, taking O(n)time in 
//the worst case.

// Let's say we have a sorted array of numbers. To find a number with a binary 
//search, we:

// Start with the middle number: is it bigger or smaller than our target number? 
//Since the array is sorted, this tells us if the target would be in the left half 
//or the right half of our array.
// We've effectively divided the problem in half. We can "rule out" the whole half 
//of the array that we know doesn't contain the target number.
// Repeat the same approach (of starting in the middle) on the new half-size problem. Then do it again and again, until we either find the number or "rule out" the whole set.
// We can do this recursively, or iteratively.

//How did we know the time cost of binary search was O(lg(n))? 
//The only non-constant part of our time cost is the number of times our while 
//loop runs. Each step of our while loop cuts the range 
//(dictated by floorIndex and ceilingIndex) in half, until our range 
//has just one element left.

//Careful: only use binary search if the input array is already sorted.

// Complexity: 
// O(n) time and O(1) space
