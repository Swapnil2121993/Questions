// Write a function to find the 2nd largest element in a binary search tree.â†´

// Here's a sample binary tree node class:

// class BinaryTreeNode {
//     constructor(value) {
//         this.value = value;
//         this.left = null;
//         this.right = null;
//     }

//     insertLeft(value) {
//         this.left = new BinaryTreeNode(value);
//         return this.left;
//     }

//     insertRight(value) {
//         this.right = new BinaryTreeNode(value);
//         return this.right;
//     }
// }


function findLargest(rootNode) {
    let current = rootNode;
    while (current) {
        if (!current.right) return current.value
        return current = current.right
    }
}

function findSecondLargest(rootNode) {
    let current = rootNode;

    if (!current || (!current.left && !current.right)) {
        console.log('tree must have atleast two nodes')
    }

    while (current) {
        // Case: current is largest and has a left subtree
        // 2nd largest is the largest in that subtree
        if (current.left && !current.right) {
            return findLargest(current.left);
        }

        // Case: current is parent of largest, and largest has no children,
        // so current is 2nd largest
        if (current.right && !current.right.right && !current.left.left) {
            return current.value;
        }

        current = current.right;
    }
}
// Solution
// We start with a function for getting the largest value. The largest value 
//is simply the "rightmost" one, so we can get it in one walk down the tree 
//by traversing rightward until we don't have a right child anymore:

// With this in mind, we can also find the second largest in one walk down the tree. 
//At each step, we have a few cases:

// If we have a left subtree but not a right subtree, then the current node 
//is the largest overall (the "rightmost") node. The second largest element 
//must be the largest element in the left subtree. We use our findLargest() 
//function above to find the largest in that left subtree!

// If we have a right child, but that right child node doesn't have any children, 
//then the right child must be the largest element and our current node must be 
//the second largest element!

// Else, we have a right subtree with more than one element, so the largest 
//and second largest are somewhere in that subtree. So we step right.

// Complexity
// We're doing one walk down our BST, which means O(h) time, where h is the 
//height of the tree (again, that's O(lg{n}) if the tree is balanced, 
//O(n) otherwise). O(1) space.

// What We Learned
// Here we used a "simplify, solve, and adapt" strategy.

//The question asks for a function to find the second largest element in a BST, 
//so we started off by simplifying the problem: we thought about how to find 
//the first largest element.

//Once we had a strategy for that, we adapted that strategy to work for 
//finding the second largest element.

//It may seem counter-intuitive to start off by solving the wrong question. 
//But starting off with a simpler version of the problem is often much faster, 
//because it's easier to wrap our heads around right away.

// One more note about this one:

// Breaking things down into cases is another strategy that really helped us here.

//Notice how simple finding the second largest node got when we divided it 
//into two cases:

// The largest node has a left subtree.
// The largest node does not have a left subtree.
// Whenever a problem is starting to feel complicated, try breaking it down into cases.

// It can be really helpful to actually draw out sample inputs for those cases. 
//This'll keep your thinking organized and also help get your interviewer 
//on the same page.
